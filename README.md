# Project Title: Student Record System

Create a simple **Student Record System** in C that allows users to manage student information. The program should include the following functionality:

## Initial Setup:

- Create a new C project using **JetBrains CLion** (or your preferred development environment).
- Write a program that displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter their name. The program should greet the user by their name.

## Data Storage:

- Implement storage for student information, including **name**, **roll number**, and **marks**, using appropriate data types.

## Input and Output:

- Add a feature to input a student's marks and display whether the student has passed or failed based on a passing threshold (e.g., marks above 40 are considered passing).

## Student Records Management:

- Implement a loop that allows the user to input information for multiple students until the user decides to exit.
- Create an array to store information for multiple students, with the ability to **add**, **remove**, and **modify** student records.
- Implement functions for adding, modifying, and displaying student records. Ensure these functions take appropriate arguments and return relevant information.

## Memory Management:

- Use **dynamic memory allocation** for student records and ensure memory is freed when no longer needed.

## File Operations:

- Implement the ability to **save student records** to a text file and **load student records** from a text file, storing information such as name, roll number, and marks.

## Search Functionality:

- Allow users to **search for a student by their roll number** and display the relevant information.

## Calculations and Sorting:

- Calculate and display the **average marks** for all students.
- Provide an option to **sort student records** based on marks in ascending or descending order.
